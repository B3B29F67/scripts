create resources of all types in AWS
    - Terraform? 
- run AWS bash script and assert correct count
- run AWS pwsh script and assert correct count

rinse and repeat for Azure, GCP
ensure teardown of resources once complete

no expectation of CI/CD at this time...just enough tools to validate code changes work as expected
